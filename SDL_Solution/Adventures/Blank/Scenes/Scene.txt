String for Scene Title (Automatically set to 'Scene' + scene number
Number of Commands

Command ID
Followed by Command specific data

read ID, then read specific data

base Command class
child class for each type of command
each child has a 'read' function
maybe a 'do' function?
a 'quick do' as well

slight amount of time between doing each command
	(if timer^ is going, quick do won't do anything)


DIALOGUE
index for character
string for the words said

print out character name (e.g. 'SIMMONS: ', with colon and space)
	if name = NARRATOR, do not print out name
print out words over time, same amount of time for each letter (0.1f?)

END
1-byte value for index of next scene
Maybe shows scene name of next scene on screen?
stores value, deletes current scene, allocates next scene, restart loop of commands

CHOICE
1-byte value for number of choices
string for each of the choices followed by scene value for next scene to go to

print out strings (e.g. 'Go into the cave.')
then add them to a seperate list to be checked against for input
exits from command loop to wait for that input
when input is pressed
	stores next scene value
	deletes current scene
	allocates next scene
	restart loop of commands

WIN/LOSE
boolean value (0/1) for if it is a win or loss
0 for loss, 1 for win

adds button for returning to the
	last choice made
	beginning of adventure
	select screen
then exits the command loop

scene value for last choice made is saved always
	(0 if no choices, and won't show button in that case)
	deletes scene and makes new one, restarts command loop
delete scene, and allocate the first one again (always 1 as first scene)
does typical game shutdown and reloads the select screen
